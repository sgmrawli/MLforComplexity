Splitting of the .csv (produced in section 2) into training, validation and testing sets is done here.
 - The ratio of sets can be edited in the code directly.
 - The formula are used to split the sets, so there is no crossover in structures

The split sets are taken in by the RF model program to predict total information content
 - The complexity parameter to be predicted can be changed in the code
