The outputs folder is directly taken from section 1, after the programs there had finished.
The outputs were cleaned, removing failed cifs and then converted to one .csv file

The ICSD code was recorded for each entry in the three separate outputs. 
This makes it easier for the output files to be linked across the three .txt files
